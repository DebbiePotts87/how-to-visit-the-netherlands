# Bugs

### Header Section
I wanted to impliment a Bootstrap navigation snippit which would ensure the navigation bar is responisve for mobile and tablet and also due to the city name sizes the hamburger menu suits smaller devices better as it looks much cleaner and is far more user friendly. 
    * Bootstrap navigation templates fills the full width of the screen so I customised their recommended code snippet to suit the needs of this website.
    * The hamburger icon was placed to the left of its container so I used google dev tools to inspect the area and find the section of Bootstrap which needed overiding.
    * The hamburger menu icon was defaulted to black, to change this to white I had to change the Bootstap nav bar theme to dark and then overide the background colour.

# Credits

* Navigation section
    * I used the Bootstrap documentation as a guide for making the responsive navigation bar, mainly the button.
